        <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
        <p>
            Husky Running Club is a student organization at the University of Washington devoted to running.
            Continue where you left off with your high school cross-country days, start running for the first time, or start trying new distances!

            Neither membership nor previous running experience is required, merely a desire to meet others and run.
            We also host potlucks once or twice a quarter and several weekend trail runs throughout the year. <b>Everyone is welcome!</b>
