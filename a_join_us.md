Husky Running Club has no official "membership" requirement; all students are welcome to come running with us anytime they wish. However, if you plan to run with us regularly, we do recommend that you do a few things to help us and you:

#### Fill Out IMA Waiver For HRC

- Go to <a href="www.imleagues.com/Washington/RecClubs/" target="_blank">IMLeagues</a>.
- Create an IMLeagues account under University of Washington with your UW email.
- You will be sent an activation email, click the link in the email to login and activate your account.
- Click the Rec Clubs button near the banner.
- Find "Running" in the list of clubs and click on it.
- Click "Join Team".
- Complete the required forms.
- If you have any questions about the process, you can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uwhuskyrunningclub" target="_blank">send us a message</a>.

<!-- - First visit <a href="https://reg.recreation.uw.edu/" target="_blank">the UW recreation site</a> and login with your UW NetID by clicking the "Log In" link in the **upper righthand** corner and choosing the large box at the top that says "UW NetID."
- Click on the menu in the upper left-hand corner of the website (it looks like three dashes stacked atop one another), and then click on the "Rec Clubs" link.
- Click on the "Club Waiver" option.
- Find "Running Club" in the list of clubs, and click "Register." 
- To sign the document, you must <b>click</b> on the grey box at the bottom-right of the page, and a popup will appear where you can use your cursor to sign. Click "Sign Now" when you're satisfied with your signature.
- You will be guided through the process of adding emergency contacts. Once finished, click "Check Out" -- it appears like an online cart, but the price is free, so don't worry. If you have any questions about the process, you can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uwhuskyrunningclub" target="_blank">send us a message</a>.	 -->
